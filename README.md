I'm messing with webpack

I finished this chapter http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack/
and this one: http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/webpack_and_react/
and this one: http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/implementing_notes/
and this one http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/react_and_flux/
and this one http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/from_notes_to_kanban/
and this one http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/implementing_dnd/

In the last section, the interaction of editing became a little weird. Not sure if I have a small bug somewhere or if this is how the code quiesces.
